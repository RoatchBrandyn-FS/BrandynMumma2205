- Without login credentials for testing purposes, the current pages built should be able to notifiy when edit text fields aren;t filled in correctly. If an alert doesn't show, then all fields should be filled in. If all fields aren't filled in, an alert should pop up telling the user what was wrong and how to fix it.
